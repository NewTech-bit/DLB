# Deep Learning Bootcamp University of Applied Sciences Lucerne, MSc in Applied Information and Data Science
There have been two tasks carried out:

1. Based on a Kaggle Dataset, some different types of basic Sequential Neural Networks are applied:
- model with CountVectorizer
- model with Tfidf Vectorizer
- model with Word Embeddings
- model with dropout layer
- model with RNN architecture

2. A neural network has been built for detecting images of cats and dogs:
- DLB_FinalDataChallenge_vFinal
